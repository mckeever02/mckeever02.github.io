testimonial:
    content: |
        There are not words adequate to describe Michael... unicorn, perhaps, but any word would be inadequate to convey the depth of his talent, collaboration and empathy. I was lucky enough to hire him onto my Design team and be his collaborator for two years. He made me better, as a UX pro and as a person. Michael easily moves between vision, design execution and building, seemingly without breaking a sweat. Yet, he's also humble. It is a powerful combination.

        As his copywriter, I adopted a mantra: WWMR? (What Would Michael Read?) to bring conciseness and clarity to the words I added to his UIs. As a researcher, he eagerly learned to make high quality observations and interpretations of user behavior during usability testing better than researchers who've been working for years.

        I unreservedly recommend Michael for his initiative, strategic thinking, flawless execution and kindness. You will be better for having worked with him.

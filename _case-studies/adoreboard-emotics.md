    content: "<a href='https://adoreboard.com'>Adoreboard</a> brought me in to work alongside their product team to redesign Emotics, an emotion analytics product. It's used by consultants and agencies to analyse large sets of social data to provide insights for brands and research institutions."

    title: "UX Audit"
    content: "Before jumping in with the redesign it was important to get familiar with their current iteration of the product and start figuring out the pain points. Emotics was still in beta at this stage and hadn't yet been released to customers but the internal consultants were already utilising it for live projects. They proved to be invaluable for gathering feedback on current weaknesses in the product and discussing new features."

    title_2: "Some of the pain points"
    list_2:
        - Difficulty uploading datasets
        - Difficulty sorting through uploaded data as this was all done within the sidebar
        - Viewing topics and snippets was confusing, with no indication of where to access them or dig deeper for further analysis
        - Too much functionality and actions were contained within the small space of the sidebar
section_2:
    title: "Storyboards"
    content: "Once I had spent time with the current product and gathered feedback on the aspects of the product that needed improved, I started storyboarding and creating low fidelity wireframes of the product."

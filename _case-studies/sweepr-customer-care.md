    content: "One of my main roles at Sweepr was leading the design for the mobile experience. This involved designing a customer support experience that user‚Äôs would use within their own homes to self-diagnose and fix their home technology problems."
goals:
    - title: More value
      icon: üéØ
      content: "Provide more value for the user and their home. It can be more than just a support input."
    - title: More flexibility
      icon: ü§∏‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
      content: "Give more flexibility to our customers to implement their own features & values and integrate seamlessly within their own platform. It's a big ask to take over a client's Support page and not provide more flexible options."
    - title: More context
      icon: ü§ê
      content: "Better context framing for the user is necessary so they can understand what it is they should say or type to be provided with self-support."
    - title: More proactive
      icon: üèãÔ∏è
      content: "Our current use cases are based on being reactive to the user's network and not proactive. Rather than routinely scanning their network to anticipate and identify possible problems we wait for the user to come to us. By this point, they're already having a negative experience and it becomes much more challenging to turn that into a positive experience."

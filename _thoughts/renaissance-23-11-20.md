Now that we're over the halfway mark for this global pandemic, I've been wondering what life will be like once it's finally ended. Will things just go back to normal, as they were pre-COVID? Or is the world forever changed? Never to return to how it once was, Ã  la post-9/11.

As with all things, I don't think it'll be that simple. Certain things will return back to how they once were (going to the cinema, hugging friends, seeing your grandparents, music concerts) but other things I think will stay forever changed (working in an office, travelling for work, attending conferences).

Neevertheless, I can forsee a type of renaissance taking place as the pandemic comes to an end. A small fragment in time as we all appreciate the things that were lost or forgotten. It'll a time of large cultural significance for our generation, with lots of art, film & music to remember this time in our lives that we soon not forget.

But just like all things, eventually, we'll take this all for granted and things will have returned to normal. Us humans are often quick to forget.

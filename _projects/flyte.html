<p>After carrying out the design for their web app, Flyte contacted me to design their mobile app. Flyte is an Irish drone startup (now ceased trading) that specialised in software and planning for commercial drone pilots. The purpose of the app was to compliment their web app to allow customers to track and manage their planned drone flights (done through the web app) when out and about.</p>

<p>The first step was to plan out the user journey for a customer using the app.</p>

<p>As the app was intended for already paying customers of Flyte, the user journey for the mobile app would be quite simple. There would be no registration process as users of the app would already be registered customers.</p>

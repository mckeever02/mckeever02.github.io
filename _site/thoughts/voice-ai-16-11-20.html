<p>I’ve been listening to a lot of audiobooks this year. One thing I’ve found is that an audiobook can be hit or miss, not just on the content but also the narrator. If the narrator is bad, then I find the book unlistenable, which is a shame.</p>

<p>Problem is, what makes a good narrator can be subjective to the listener. It could be accent, tone, gender, age etc. All of these possible factors playing into whether you like or dislike a narrator.</p>

<p>So wouldn’t it be be cool if you could browse narrators and pick one that you like? Or a narrator that mimics the voice in your head? I can definitely see a future where this is an option. I would bet Amazon is already working on something to this effect. AI can already synthesize voice to a point where its almost indistinguishable. There a lots of business cases for this as well. Creating audiobooks is timely and expensive, especially when it involves multiple voice actors and languages. As more and more people switch to audiobooks, I can see a big disruption in this industry in the coming years.</p>
